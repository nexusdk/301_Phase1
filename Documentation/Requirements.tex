\section{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{Purpose of Document}
\paragraph{The purpose of this document is to make an agreement between the developers and the client Mr Jan Kroeze from the Department of Computer Science about the requirements of the new Marks System that needs to be developed. This document is to ensure the scope of the project is correct and clear to all the stakeholders in this project. This document the basis for which further phases will be built on.}
\subsection{Project Scope}
\paragraph{The scope of the project is to develope a software solution which reduces the paper work of marking students of a course in the Computer Science Department for lectures and markers. It also will uphold the privicy of the students so that other students can't see their mark. Reducing the paper work reduces the chances that marks can be lost.Lectures will also be able to get data on test or practicals like for example the normal distribution.}
\subsection{Document conventions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation formulation: LaTeX
\item UML: Class diagrams and activity diagrams

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\paragraph{
This specifies constraints on the way that the problem must be solved. Describe the mandated technology or solution. You should also explain the reason for using the technology. The constraints are treated as a type of requirement.}
\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\paragraph{The current system will be implemented in different environments. The first being in the form of a web service whereby lectures can access information about marks and assessments of students, and students can access their marks individually by going on to the website and entering the user name and password.
The second environment being smartphones through an android application meant to be used by tutors and teaching assistants to record marks, and also by lectures in special cases such as helping tutors and/or teaching assistants with marking.}

\section{The Scope of the Product}
\subsection{Product Boundary}
\paragraph{}
A use case diagram identifies the boundaries between the users (actors) and the product you are about to build (this is sometimes called "the system"). You arrive at the product boundary by inspecting each business use case and determining, in conjunction with the appropriate stakeholders, which part of the business use case should be automated (or satisfied by some sort of product) and what part should be done by the user. This task must take into account the abilities of the actors (section 2), the constraints (section 3), the goals of the project (section 1), and your knowledge of both the work and the technology that can make the best contribution to the work.
The use case diagram shows the actors/users outside the product boundary (the rectangle). The product use cases (PUCs) are the ellipses inside the boundary. The numbers link each PUC back to the BUC that it came from (see section 6). The lines denote usage. Note that actors can be either automated or human.
\paragraph{}
Derive the PUCs by deciding where the product boundary should be for each business use case (BUC). These decisions are based on your knowledge of the work and the requirements constraints. Note that the PUCs that you come up with must be traceable back to the BUCs. The numbers on the PUC diagram correspond to the BUC numbers on the Business Event List (see section 6).

\section{Functional Requirements}
\paragraph{}
Functional requirements are the fundamental or essential subject matter of the product. They describe what the product has to do or what processing actions it is to take.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Requirements Shell}
\paragraph{}
Each atomic requirement is made up of a number of attributes. The requirements shell is a guide to writing each atomic functional (section 9) and non-functional requirements (sections 10-17). Here is an example of the content of the shell shown in graphic form. The shell can and should be automated.
